# 4. Creating a Portal

We have our `Blogging` feature package with `Post` and `Comment` resources, but no user interface to manage them. Let's create a **Portal** to serve as a web interface for our blog.

## What are Portal Packages?

While Feature Packages hold business logic, **Portal Packages** provide the web interface. They are also Rails Engines, but they are responsible for things like:

- Dashboards and layouts.
- Routing requests to the correct resources.
- Handling user authentication for the interface.

We'll create a `Dashboard` portal for managing our blog.

## Generate the Portal

Plutonium has a generator for portals. In your terminal, run:

```bash
rails generate pu:pkg:portal dashboard
```

The generator will ask which authentication account to use. We already set up the `user` account with Rodauth, so **select `user`**.

This creates a new package at `packages/dashboard_portal/` and wires it up for authentication.

## Connect Resources to the Portal

Now we need to tell our new `Dashboard` portal which resources it should manage. We can use the `pu:res:conn` (connect) generator for this.

Run the connect generator:
```bash
rails generate pu:res:conn
```

It will ask you a series of questions:
1.  **Select source feature**: Choose **`blogging`**.
2.  **Select resources**: Use the spacebar to select both **`Blogging::Post`** and **`Blogging::Comment`**, then press Enter.
3.  **Select destination portal**: Choose **`dashboard_portal`**.

This command does the magic of connecting your feature logic to your UI. It updates the portal's routes file (`packages/dashboard_portal/config/routes.rb`) to register the resources:

```ruby
# packages/dashboard_portal/config/routes.rb
DashboardPortal::Engine.routes.draw do
  root to: "dashboard#index"

  register_resource Blogging::Post
  register_resource Blogging::Comment
end
```

## Configure Application Routes

There's one last step. We need to tell our main Rails application how to handle routing for authentication and the new dashboard.

1.  **Update Rodauth Redirects**: We want users to be sent to the dashboard after they log in or sign up.

    ```ruby [app/rodauth/user_rodauth_plugin.rb]
    # ==> Redirects

    # Redirect to home after login.
    create_account_redirect "/" # [!code --]
    create_account_redirect "/dashboard" # [!code ++]

    # Redirect to home after login.
    login_redirect "/" # [!code --]
    login_redirect "/dashboard" # [!code ++]

    # Redirect to home page after logout.
    logout_redirect "/" # [!code --]
    logout_redirect "/dashboard" # [!code ++]
    ```

2.  **Update Root Route**: We'll make the dashboard the root of our application.

    ```ruby [config/routes.rb]
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      # ...
      # Defines the root path route ("/")
      # root "posts#index" # [!code --]
      root to: redirect("/dashboard") # [!code ++]
    end
    ```

## See it in Action!

Let's check our progress. Start your Rails server (`bin/dev`) and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You will be redirected to `/dashboard` and should see the login page.

- **Sign up** for a new account.
- After signing up, you'll be redirected to the dashboard. It will be empty for now, but this confirms the portal and authentication are working!

## Next Steps

We now have a functional dashboard! It's not very useful yet, though.

In the next chapter, we will customize the user interface to display our posts and comments, and add navigation to make them accessible.
