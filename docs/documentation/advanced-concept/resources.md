## Introduction

Resources are the core building blocks of a Plutonium application. A resource represents a model in your application that can be managed through a consistent interface, complete with views, controllers, and policies.

## Creating a Resource

The fastest way to create a resource is using the scaffold generator:

```bash
rails generate pu:res:scaffold Blog user:belongs_to \
  title:string content:text 'published_at:datetime?'
```

This generates several files, including:

::: code-group

```ruby [app/models/blog.rb]
class Blog < ResourceRecord
  belongs_to :user
end
```

```ruby [app/policies/blog_policy.rb]
class BlogPolicy < Plutonium::Resource::Policy
  def create?
    true
  end

  def read?
    true
  end

  def permitted_attributes_for_create
    %i[user title content published_at]
  end

  def permitted_attributes_for_read
    %i[user title content published_at]
  end
end
```

```ruby [app/definitions/blog_definition.rb]
class BlogDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
end
```

:::

## Resource Definitions

Resource definitions customize how a resource behaves in your application. They define:

- Fields and their types
- Available actions
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Sorting options
- Display configurations

### Basic Field Configuration

::: code-group

```ruby [Simple Fields]
class BlogDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # Basic field definitions
  field :content, as: :text

  # Field with custom display options
  field :published_at,
        as: :datetime,
        hint: "When this post should be published"
end
```

```ruby [Custom Displays]
class BlogDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # Customize how fields are displayed
  display :title, wrapper: {class: "col-span-full"}
  display :content, wrapper: {class: "col-span-full"} do |f|
    f.text_tag class: "format dark:format-invert"
  end

  # Custom column display in tables
  column :published_at, align: :end
end
```

:::

<!--
### Working with Associations

Plutonium makes it easy to work with Rails associations:

```ruby
class BlogDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # Define belongs_to association
  field :user, as: :belongs_to

  # Has-many association with inline creation
  field :comments do |f|
    f.has_many_tag nested: true
  end

  # Configure nested attributes
  define_nested_input :comments,
    inputs: %i[content user],
    limit: 3 do |input|
      input.define_field_input :content,
        type: :text,
        hint: "Keep it constructive"
    end
end
```
-->

### Adding Custom Actions

Beyond CRUD, you can add custom actions to your resources:

```ruby
# app/interactions/blogs/publish.rb
module Blogs
  class Publish < Plutonium::Resource::Interaction
    # Define what this interaction accepts
    attribute :resource, class: Blog
    attribute :publish_date, :date, default: -> { Time.current }

    presents label: "Publish Blog",
             icon: Phlex::TablerIcons::Send,
             description: "Make this blog post public"

    private

    def execute
      if resource.update(
        published_at: publish_date
      )
        succeed(resource)
          .with_message("Blog post published successfully")
          .with_redirect_response(resource)
      else
        failed(resource.errors)
      end
    end
  end
end

# app/definitions/blog_definition.rb
class BlogDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # Register the custom action
  action :publish,
    interaction: Blogs::Publish,
    category: :primary
end
```

### Search and Filtering

Add search and filtering capabilities to your resources:

```ruby
class BlogDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # Enable full-text search
  search do |scope, query|
    scope.where("title ILIKE ? OR content ILIKE ?",
      "%#{query}%", "%#{query}%")
  end

  # Add filters
  filter :published_at,
    with: DateFilter,
    predicate: :gteq

  # Add scopes
  scope :published do |scope|
    scope.where.not(published_at: nil)
  end
  scope :draft do |scope|
    scope.where(published_at: nil)
  end

  # Configure sorting
  sort :title
  sort :published_at

  # Configure default sorting (newest first)
  default_sort :published_at, :desc
end
```

## Resource Policies

Policies control access to your resources:

```ruby
class BlogPolicy < Plutonium::Resource::Policy
  def permitted_attributes_for_create
    %i[title content state published_at user_id]
  end

  def permitted_associations
    %i[comments]
  end

  def create?
    # Allow logged in users to create blogs
    user.present?
  end

  def update?
    # Users can only edit their own blogs
    record.user_id == user.id
  end

  def publish?
    # Only editors can publish
    user.editor? && record.draft?
  end

  # Scope visible records
  relation_scope do |relation|
    relation = super(relation)
    next relation unless user.admin?

    relation.with_deleted
  end
end
```

## Best Practices

::: tip Resource Organization

1. Keep resource definitions focused and cohesive
2. Use packages to organize related resources
3. Leverage policy scopes for authorization
4. Extract complex logic into interactions
5. Use presenters for view-specific logic
   :::

::: warning Common Pitfalls

- Avoid putting business logic in definitions
- Don't bypass policy checks
- Remember to scope resources appropriately
- Test your interactions and policies

# Deep Dive: Building a Resource

In Plutonium, a **Resource** is the central concept for managing your application's data. It's more than just a modelâ€”it's a complete package that includes the model, controller, policy, views, and all the configuration that ties them together.

This guide will walk you through building a complete `Post` resource from scratch, demonstrating how Plutonium's different modules work together to create a powerful and consistent user experience.

## 1. Generating the Resource

We'll start with the scaffold generator, which creates all the necessary files for our `Post` resource.

```bash
rails generate pu:res:scaffold Post user:belongs_to title:string content:text published_at:datetime
```

This command generates:

- A `Post` model with the specified attributes and a `belongs_to :user` association.
- A `PostsController`.
- A `PostPolicy` with basic permissions.
- A `PostDefinition` file, which will be the focus of this guide.

## 2. Configuring Display & Forms (The Definition File)

The **Definition** file (`app/definitions/post_definition.rb`) is where you declaratively configure how your resource is displayed and edited. Let's start by defining the fields for our table, detail page, and form.

::: code-group

```ruby [app/definitions/post_definition.rb]
class PostDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # Configure the table (index view)
  column :user, label: "Author"
  column :published_at, as: :datetime

  # Configure the detail page (show view)
  display :user, label: "Author"
  display :published_at, as: :datetime
  display :content, as: :rich_text

  # Configure the form (new/edit views)
  input :user, as: :select, label: "Author" # Explicitly use a select input
  input :content, as: :rich_text
end
```

```ruby [app/policies/post_policy.rb]
# In the policy, we must permit these attributes to be read and written.
class PostPolicy < Plutonium::Resource::Policy
  # ...

  def permitted_attributes_for_read
    [:title, :user, :published_at, :content]
  end

  def permitted_attributes_for_create
    [:title, :user_id, :content]
  end

  def permitted_attributes_for_update
    permitted_attributes_for_create
  end
end
```

:::

Here, we've used the `display` helper to control the `index` and `show` views, and the `input` helper for the forms. We've also specified `:rich_text` to get a WYSIWYG editor for our content. Notice that we also had to permit these attributes in the policy.

## 3. Adding a Custom Action

Standard CRUD is great, but most applications have custom business logic. Let's add a "Publish" action. This involves creating an **Interaction** for the logic and registering it in the definition.

::: code-group

```ruby [app/interactions/post_interactions/publish.rb]
module PostInteractions
  class Publish < Plutonium::Resource::Interaction
    attribute :resource, class: "Post"

    private

    def execute
      resource.update(published_at: Time.current)
      succeed(resource).with_message("Post was successfully published.")
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby [app/definitions/post_definition.rb]
class PostDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # ... (display and input helpers)

  action :publish,
    interaction: "PostInteractions::Publish",
    category: :primary
end
```

```ruby [app/policies/post_policy.rb]
class PostPolicy < Plutonium::Resource::Policy
  # ... (attribute permissions)

  # An action is only visible if its policy returns true.
  def publish?
    # Only show the publish button if the post is not yet published.
    update? && record.published_at.nil?
  end
end
```

:::

We now have a "Publish" button on our `Post` detail page that only appears when appropriate, thanks to the combination of the Interaction, Definition, and Policy.

## 4. Configuring Search, Filters, and Sorting

To make our resource table more useful, let's add search, filtering, and sorting capabilities. This is all handled declaratively in the definition file.

```ruby
# app/definitions/post_definition.rb
class PostDefinition < Plutonium::Resource::Definition
  # ... (display, input, and action helpers)

  # Enable full-text search across title and content
  search do |scope, query|
    scope.where("title ILIKE :q OR content ILIKE :q", q: "%#{query}%")
  end

  # Add filters to the sidebar
  filter :published, with: ->(scope, value) { value ? scope.where.not(published_at: nil) : scope.where(published_at: nil) }, as: :boolean
  filter :user, as: :select, choices: User.pluck(:name, :id)

  # Define named scopes that appear as buttons
  scope :all
  scope :published, -> { where.not(published_at: nil) }
  scope :drafts, -> { where(published_at: nil) }

  # Configure which columns are sortable
  sort :title
  sort :published_at
end
```

With just a few lines of code, we now have a powerful and interactive table view for our posts, complete with a search bar, filter sidebar, scope buttons, and sortable columns. This demonstrates how the **Resource** module integrates seamlessly with the **Query** module.
