Description:
    Syncs Claude Code skills from the Plutonium gem into your project's
    .claude/skills/ directory.

    This gives Claude Code access to Plutonium-specific skills for:
    - Creating resources (scaffold generator)
    - Connecting resources to portals
    - Definition configuration (fields, actions, queries)

Example:
    rails generate pu:skills:sync

    This will copy all skills from the Plutonium gem to:
        .claude/skills/
